# Cat Painting

This project is a fun CSS-based illustration of a cat's face. The HTML and CSS code together create a simple but expressive representation of a cat, including its head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and whiskers.

## Project Structure

- **HTML File (`index.html`)**: Defines the structure of the cat painting, including various parts like the head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and whiskers.
- **CSS File (`styles.css`)**: Contains the styles used to create the cat painting, including positioning, border-radius for shapes, and background colors.
