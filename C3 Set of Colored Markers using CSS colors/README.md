# Colored Markers

This project demonstrates how to create simple colored markers using HTML and CSS. Each marker is styled with different colors and effects to create a visual representation of a marker.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file that sets up the structure of the markers.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the markers and their container.

## HTML Structure
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-%23E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=HTML5&logoColor=white)

The HTML file contains:

- A heading `<h1>` that titles the page.
- A container `<div class="container">` that holds the marker elements.
- Three marker elements, each with a color class (`red`, `green`, `blue`), and child `<div>` elements for the cap and sleeve of the marker.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file includes:

- Centered text for the heading.
- Basic styling for the container to give it a background color and padding.
- Styling for the marker elements to set their size, margin, and display properties.
- Gradient backgrounds and shadow effects for the marker colors:
  - **Red**: A gradient with shades of red and a red shadow.
  - **Green**: A gradient with shades of green and a green shadow.
  - **Blue**: A gradient with shades of blue and a blue shadow.
- A semi-transparent background and double border for the marker sleeve.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the colored markers.
2. Edit `styles.css` to customize the appearance of the markers as needed.
